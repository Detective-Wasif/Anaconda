# Anaconda

Intended to turn out to be the Shinigami for other golflangs

My main goal is to beat all other golfing languages, plus I refuse to call Anaconda an esolang, Because I intend to put many features in it besides golfing.

**Heavy WIP**

Online interpreter is designed. To run that locally:

- Clone the repo
- Fire up a terminal
- cd to the repo
- Run `python3 server.py` (Make sure Flask,Tkinter,Numpy and Sympy is installed)
- Open `127.0.0.1:7777` in your browser
- Done!
